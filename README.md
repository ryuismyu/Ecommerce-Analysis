# E-commerce Sales Analysis Dashboard

I have cleaned and explored data using SQL and excel, and made an excel dashboard analyzing sales from an e-commerce dataset. The dashboard analyzes top products, monthly revenue trends, as well as revenue by country.


## Business Objective

To build a dashboard to understand product trends over time as well as region, building key KPIs such as top products by revenue, monthly trends and average revenue per customer.

## Dataset

- **Source:** [E-Commerce Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carrie1/ecommerce-data)  
- **Key Fields:** Description, Quantity, UnitPrice, CustomerID, Country, Revenue

## Key Insights from the Dashboard and SQL analysis

-The top country in sales was overwhelmingly the United Kingdom, which makes sense as this is a UK-based online retailer, accounting for 87% of total revenue with $9M in the span of one year, and $4.6M in units bought, with the next closest country in revenue being Netherlands at $285K.
-The monthly revenue trend showed sales were highest from September to november, with a steep drop off in December
- The customer group, registered (all customers with a customer ID) accounted for $8.9M in revenue with $1.76M coming from customers without a customer ID (Guest)
